# House_Grade_Predictions

Project Description
This project aims to help customers choose the right city for relocation based on various parameters. The project involves data cleaning using NumPy and pandas, visualization using matplotlib and seaborn, preprocessing the data using label encoding, and developing machine learning models. The models evaluated include logistic regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, decision tree, decision tree classifier with stratified k-fold cross-validation, random forest ensembling method, and stacking. The goal is to determine the ML model that provides better predictive results for aiding customers in their city relocation decisions.

Features
Data Cleaning: Clean the dataset using NumPy and pandas to handle missing values, remove outliers, and ensure data consistency.
Visualization: Visualize the data using matplotlib and seaborn to gain insights and identify patterns.
Preprocessing: Preprocess the data by performing label encoding to convert categorical variables into numerical representations.
Model Building: Develop machine learning models including logistic regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, decision tree, decision tree classifier with stratified k-fold cross-validation, random forest ensembling method, and stacking.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
Predictive Analysis: Use the selected ML model to predict the best city for relocation based on given parameters.
GitHub Repository: Store all code and resources in a GitHub repository for easy access and collaboration.
